# Indian-Citizenship-Article-Dataset
This project delves into the 2019 enactment of India’s Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), analyzing its social, legal, and political implications through quantitative and qualitative methods. By assessing public sentiment, media coverage, legal proceedings, public protests, and government statements, the study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the CAA's impact and effectiveness. Through sentiment analysis, correlation matrices, and regression models, the research gauges the complexities surrounding the act, examining how it compares with similar international citizenship laws. Findings reveal that, while the CAA has extended humanitarian benefits and gained political backing within India, it faces significant challenges from public opposition, alleged discrimination, and administrative hurdles, presenting a mixed outlook on its successful implementation. This nuanced analysis highlights the CAA’s strengths and limitations, contributing to the broader discourse on citizenship and human rights legislation.
