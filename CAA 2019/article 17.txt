INDIA’S CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT ACT VIOLATES
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS
By Talia Lewis*
ABSTRACT
The Citizenship Amendment Act, recently passed legislation, comes
on the heels of a very tumultuous number of years, months, and weeks in
India. Most notably, Muslim communities and citizens fear the upheaval of
their way of life due to the decisions of the Hindu-majority who controls the
political actions of the democratic republic. These Muslim groups are not the
only worried parties. International humanitarian bodies have spoken out
against various recent actions of India’s government. The Citizenship
Amendment Act, if considered in the context of other actions by the governing
party in India, should be understood as violative of International human
rights laws and norms. India is subject to the standards set in United Nations
(UN) documents because it is party to covenants and declarations. This paper
discusses the formation of the UN bodies, which later promulgated such
treaties and declarations. It discusses the evolution of UN human rights law,
how it has applied in the past, and how it could be applied to the current
situation in India and its enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act.
Moreover, this paper will review the India’s current events and how recent
history gave rise to the issues of religious intolerance that exist there, at
present. In short, this paper concludes that there is a persuasive argument
that India’s Citizenship Amendment Act violates international human rights
laws and norms.
